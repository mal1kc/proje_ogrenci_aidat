                This application, named "OgrenciAidatSistemi", is a comprehensive school project designed to manage and streamline various aspects of a school's operations. It's built using ASP.NET Core, a robust and versatile framework that allows for the creation of dynamic web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application's architecture is well-structured, with different components neatly organized into respective directories such as Controllers, Models, Views, and Services. This structure not only enhances the readability of the code but also makes it easier to maintain and extend the application in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key features of this application is the use of Razor views, a markup syntax for embedding server-based code into web pages. The Razor view engine enables the creation of dynamic web content with a clean, fluid, and expressive syntax.
            </p>
            <p>
                The About view, for instance, is a Razor view that provides information about the application. It's an essential part of the application, serving as a point of introduction and explanation about the project's purpose, features, and functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the spirit of fun and creativity, we've also included a hidden message in the About view. Encrypted in a way that it's not immediately visible to the casual observer, the message reads 'no f wayu'. It's a playful addition that adds a touch of mystery and intrigue to the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the OgrenciAidatSistemi application is a testament to the power and flexibility of ASP.NET Core and the Razor view engine. It's a school project that not only fulfills its intended purpose but also serves as a learning platform for exploring and understanding the intricacies of web application development.
